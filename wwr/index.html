Zion Park is already a tourist attraction but I realized while was there that the tourism has decreased with the passage of time, it still has a lot of people but not compared to previous years.

                        <h2>Biking</h2>
                        <p>Zion Park and Sprindale town is perfect for biking. Through it I can find bicycle rentals that range from traditional to motorized bicycles, which is an invaluable help. There is a special road for bicycles on the street. Inside the park it is also allowed and you live an incredible experience.</p>

                        <h2>Nigth Skies</h2>
                        <p>Zion National Park has installed night-friendly fixtures at the Zion Canyon Visitor Center, Zion Human History Museum, Zion Lodge, and campgrounds that direct light downward instead of casting it upward into the sky and replaced white and blue bulbs with more night sky-friendly amber and red bulbs. In 2021, Zion National Park became certified as an International Dark Sky Park, a certification granted by the International Dark-Sky Association</p>
